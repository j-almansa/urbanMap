# Urban Mapping

This repository contains source code of a Convolutional Neural Network for
mapping urban areas on a satellite image. The implementation dates back to 2017
as part of an internship in a mapping company, and it was made with Python using
TensorFlow and [TFLearn]( http://tflearn.org/ ).
What is being shared here is not production-level-code.
